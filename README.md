Chinese Text Analysis with Jieba and Python

This project demonstrates the analysis of Chinese text using Python. By leveraging Jieba, a popular text segmentation library, the project processes a Chinese literary text to segment it into meaningful words. The frequency of each word is then calculated using pandas and Counter, providing a distribution of word occurrences. This analysis highlights linguistic patterns in Chinese texts and serves as a foundation for further exploration in computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP).

Tools used:


    Python 
    Jieba (for Chinese word segmentation)
    pandas 
    Counter 

    1. Create a Virtual Environment
    2. Install Required Packages
    3. Download or Prepare a Chinese Text:
    I used oine from  Project Gutenberg and save it as a .txt file in your project directory.
    5.Open the text and tokenize it with Jieba
    6. Use Counter from the collections module to count the frequency of each word
    7. Create a Pandas DataFrame
    8. Save the DataFrame to a CSV File

    When you run the script,
    - A CSV file that lists the frequency of each word in the Chinese text, showing how many times each word appears.
    - A word cloud that visually highlights the most common words in the text (optional, can be added with libraries like wordcloud).
    - A list of the most frequent bigrams (pairs of words) in the text.
    - Insights into the text's structure, highlighting the most common words and offering potential clues about the themes or focus of the text.

Special Thanks

    Project Gutenberg for making a wide range of texts, including Chinese literature, freely available for public use.
    Jieba for providing a powerful and easy-to-use tool for Chinese word segmentation.
